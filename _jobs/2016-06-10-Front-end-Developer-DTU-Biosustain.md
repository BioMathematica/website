The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability (DTU Biosustain) at the technical university of Denmark (DTU) is seeking a highly motivated and skilled software developer to help build a web-based software platform for data-driven design of microbial cells and communities. The Center conducts research on metabolic engineering and synthetic biology of microbial and mammalian cell factories for chemical and therapeutic protein production. The position will be within the DD-DeCaF consortium, a project recently funded by the European Commission to develop new bioinformatics approaches that leverage system-level data for biotechnological applications.
